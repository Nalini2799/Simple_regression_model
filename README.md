- This repo demonstrate the basic concept behind simple Linear regression model as well as multiple Linear regression model.
- To predict values y for an unknown x 
- A linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).
